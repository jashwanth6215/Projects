            First things first
            I'mma say all the words inside my head
            I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
            The way that things have been, oh ooh

            Second things second
            Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
            I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
            The master of my sea, oh ooh

            I was broken from a young age
            Taking my sulking to the masses
            Writing my poems for the few
            That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
            Singing from heartache from the painTaking my message from the veins
            Speaking my lesson from the brainSeeing the beauty through the...
            
            ,Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
            ,Pain!
            You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
            Pain!
            Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from...Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
 
            Third things third
            Send a prayer to the ones up above
            All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
            Your spirit up above,oh ooh

             I was choking in the crowd
             Building my rain up in the cloud
             Falling like ashes to the ground
             Hoping my feelings, they would drown
             But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
             Inhibited, limited
             Till it broke open and rained down
             it rained down, like...
